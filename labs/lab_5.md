# Lab 5: Site Selectionâ€”Tsunami Relief Center


#### Purpose

In this lab, we will consider possible locations for a relief center in the city of Florence, Oregon, for assistance in the event of a tsunami event. Florence lies in western Lane County along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. This has potential risk from tsunami events around the Pacific Rim, including ones caused by local earthquakes. Check out the website https://pnsn.org/ for more information.


#### Prerequisites

This excercise builds on skills practiced in Labs 1-4.

#### To Turn In

* Single-page map in Portable Document Format (PDF).
* Written document with lab questions in a commonly-accessible format (Microsoft Word, rich text, markdown, etc.)

Put a copy of each document:

1. Inside the `Lab#` subfolder in your student folder. It's simplest to just complete the original documents here.
2. Uploaded to the class Canvas site as listed under the lab assignment.

Submit the documents at your earliest convenience before the start of the next lab.


#### Steps

For best results, read through all instructions before starting the lab.

Note: The questions to answer in this lab relate to the process you complete in these steps. You may find it helpful to answer questions as you create the map rather than waiting until the end. Whichever method you prefer, be sure to contemplate *what you are actually doing* while completing these steps. Remember: the skill is not in following directions (or memorizing them), it's understanding what is happening.


### Part 1 - Map Instructions

Reminder: Save often! it is a good idea to save frequently. You may even want to Save As and give sequential filelenames so that you could revert to a previous version if you make a mistake that you cannot undo or if the ArcMap document gets corrupted.

#### 1.1 - Data

##### Create a new Lab5 folder, and download spatial datasets there.

Discover and download the datasets via the link provided. Be sure to note the data source, in order to provide citations on your map.

* Oregon Tsunami Evacutation Zone - 2013.
  * Link: [http://spatialdata.oregonexplorer.info/geoportal/](http://spatialdata.oregonexplorer.info/geoportal/)
  * Filename: `DOGAMI_TsunamiEvacuationZones_2013.zip`.
* Oregon City Limits - 2015.
  * Link: [http://spatialdata.oregonexplorer.info/geoportal/](http://spatialdata.oregonexplorer.info/geoportal/)
  * Filename: `citylim_2016.zip`.

##### Create a new ArcMap document.

1. Name it Lab5_Tsunami_Relief_Center.mxd.
2. Add the downloaded datasets to the default data frame.
2. Change the data frame coordinate system to Oregon's statewide coordinate system: `NAD 1983 HARN Oregon Statewide Lambert`.
  * **Note**: this will automatically happen if the first dataset is one of the above downloaded from the state library.
3. Add taxlots from the Library's Leaning Commons Data Share.

* Lane County Taxlots - 2012.
  * File location: `\\confusion.uoregon.edu\GISData\UO_GIS_Collections\US_states\Oregon\Counties\Lane_Co\Tax_lots\LaneTaxlots_2012.gdb`.
  * Filename: `LaneTaxlots2012`.


#### 1.2 - Analysis & Processing

##### Filter the city limits to only include the city of Florence.

You should now know numerous ways of only having the Florence boundaries:

1. Definition query.
2. Select and export to a new shapefile with a descriptive name (e.g. `Florence.shp`).

Which to choose is a matter of preference. Some like the clean representation of their steps in new datasets. Others prefer to not create lots of extra files. Sometimes a definition query of a large-enough dataset will perform more slowly. Either way, ArcMap will treat them exactly the same.

#####  Filter the tsunami evacuation zones to only include the zones for a 'local' tsunami.

Check the attribute table for the zone types. It's up to you whether to filter the local zones that aren't near Florence (they won't affect the map or analysis).

##### Select taxlots that are in the city of Florence.

Since definition queries cannot perform spatial queries, you'll need to export the results of a spatial selection to a new shapefile with a descriptive name (e.g. `Florence_Taxlots.shp`).

##### Filter Florence taxlots to exclude water and right-of-way taxlots.

It would make no sense to place a relief center in water or a road or other right-of-way. Luckily, the taxlot dataset has ways of identifying these types of lots:

1. Water & right-of-way lots have "taxlot" field values of `'11'`, `'22'`, `'33'`, `'44'`, `'55'`, `'66'`, `'77'`, `'88'`, `'99'` (see a pattern?).
  * If using these, do notice they are text attributes, not integers (i.e. no `<` or `>` can be used).
1. These types of taxlots also do not have a "taxcode" value, while  others do.
  * If using this, remember that null-values have a distinct query syntax: `X is NULL`, not `X = NULL`.

##### Select Florence taxlots that that are within by the tsunami evacuation zone.

Export a copy of this with a descriptive name (e.g. `Florence_Taxlots_Tsunami.shp`).

##### Compute the total potential improvement damage and number of taxlots affected.

'Improvements' is assessment & taxation jargon for buildings, structures, and any other property of value on a lot beyond its land value.

1. Open the attribute layer for the lots in the tsunami evacuation zone.
2. Find the "impval" field; right-click on the field name and choose `Statistics`.
3. Write down the values mentioned above for answering questions 1 & 2.

##TODO: FINISH FROM HERE.

##### Locate potential properties to site a tsunami relief center on.

1. Eligible taxlots will need to meet the following criteria:
  1. Be more than 500 feet from the tsunami evacuation zone;
  2. Have an improvement value less than $10,000;
  3. Cover an area ("mapacres") greater than a half-acre but less than 1 acre;
  4. Have a property class ("propcldes") of `'COMMERCIAL, VACANT'` or `'COMMERCIAL, IMPROVED'`.
2. Take some time to think about which operations are needed to answer this, including:
  1. The selection method setting when selecting part of the criteria.
  2. The spatial selection method setting when selecting by location.
  2. If combining the attribute selections into a single query, whether you need to enfore query order (parentheses).
3. After you're satisfied your selection queries have the correct result, export the selection as a new shapefile with a descriptive name (e.g. `Potential_Relief_Centers.shp`).


#### 1.2 Map and Infographic




##TODO: FINISH FROM HERE




##### Symbolize cities using graduated symbols that represent the precipitation value.

1. Read the webpage ['Using Graduated Symbols'](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/working-with-layers/using-graduated-symbols.htm).
2. Open the layer properties for the city-precipitation layer, and select the *Symbology* tab.
3. Choose `Quantities -> Graduated symbols` for the *Show* option on the left.
4. Set *Fields -> Value* to be `RASTERVALU`, your precipitation attribute.
6. Change the template symbol to the fill color of your preference.
5. Use the defaults for the other options; feel free to investigate at your leisure, though.

##### Symbolize & label counties

1. Set a visible border and no fill color.
2. Turn on the labels: right-click the layer name and choose `Label Features`. Alternatively, you can open the layer properties and check the box at the top of the *Labels* tab. This is also where you would go to change the label defaults.

##### Symbolize & label surrounding provinces.

Use a subtle color: let Washington stand out.

##### Symbolize & label states.

1. You want to show the surrounding states along with Washington now, so remove the definition query.
2. Color Washington to stand out from the surrounding states.
  1. Open the *Symbology* tab in the states layer properties, and choose `Categories -> Unique Values` from the *Show* option.
  2. Set the *Value Field* to `NAME`
  3. Click the `Add Values` button, find and select `'Washington'`. Washington now appears in the symbol list on its own.
  4. Choose a bold color for Washington, aand a subtle color for `<all other values>` that matches the color for the provinces above.
3. Label the surrounding states (not Washington; its name will be in the map title).
  1. Open the *Labels* tab of the layer properties, and check the `Label features in this layer` box.
  2. Change the *Method* option to `Define classes of features and label each class differently`.
  3. Open the now-available `SQL Query` tool, and use what you've learned about attribute queries to label all states that **are not** Washington.

##### Re-evaluate the symbolization.

Adjust the color scheme to best emphasize the map data and area of interest. Also be sure to not overwhelm the labels.

##### Place the map in the layout.

1. Switch to *Layout View*.
2. Change the paper size to 11"x17" (called 'tabloid' size).
2. Resize and place the Washington State data frame to fill a large portion of the page.
3. Pan the data frame to center on the state of Washington and zoom in so that the Washington fills most of the data frame.

##### Create an inset map.

1. Copy the current data frame & paste the copy in the layout.
2. Rename the new data frame `Olympic Peninsula`.
3. Adjust the position and size of the new data frame to fit in your layout design.
4. Pan & zoom the new data frame to capture the Olympic Peninsula as the focus. This is the large peninsula that occupies the western part of the state.
5. Add an extend indicator for the new data frame in the Washington State data frame (see Lab 3).

##### Create a county precipitation graph.

1. Open the county precipitation summary table you created (remember, only visible in *List By Source* style of Table of Contents).
2. From the *Table Options* menu (notecard-like button in upper-left corner of *Table* panel), choose `Create Graph`.
3. Step through the *Create Graph Wizard* that opened, and configure a graph that shows the precipitation by county. The color used in the graph should complement the color you used to symbolize precipitation in the map.
  1. A simple graph would be a vertical bar graph using the value `Average_RASTERVALU` (Y-value) and an X-value from the `COUNTY` field.
  2. As you alter settings, the preview will update. Make adjustments until you feel the graph is satisfactory. I would recommend improved title and labels, and possibly dropping the graph legend.
4. When you finish, the graph will appear in its own window. Right-click on the graph, and choose `Add to Layout`.
5. Resize and place the graph as appropriate in your layout.

ArcMap was designed to process and display spatial data as maps; the tools for other infographics are fairly limited in comparison to other applications. It is important to have labels and complete data on infographics, but less important to perfect the graphic design here. In a more professional GIS project workflow, infographics would probably be developed (or at least completed) in an application more attuned to graphic design.

##### Make final adjustments of graphs & maps.

Explore layout designs, finding a way to use the available space. Don't leave gaping holes, but also leave enough empty space so the layout doesn't seem overly crowded. This is an iterative process.

##### Add elements for the maps & layout.

Type, style, and place the following elements in the layout.

1. An appropriate title, representing the data presented.
2. A text caption for each map.
2. The author/cartographer's name (that's you). To help your instructors, please put this under the title or in the bottom-right corner.
3. The data source(s).
4. A direction indicator (north arrow or graticule), as appropriate.
5. A scale indicator, as appropriate.
6. A legend for the main map (`Insert->Legend`). No need to make this perfect, but do try to make it clean and readable (renaming map layer may help).

##### Make a PDF copy of your map.

1. Filename: `Lab4_Washington_Precipitation.pdf`.
2. Take a look at your exported PDF through a PDF viewing application or a web browser. **Always look at your output!** Both common and unusual errors slip past creators when they don't look at their outputs.


### Part 3 - Write-up

**Note:** Some of the questions in the write-up relate to the actions you take in making your map; you may find it helpful to answer those questions as you go, rather than waiting until after completion.

##### Instructions

1. Copy & paste the questions below into a document in your preferred word processor/text editor.
  - Be sure to use a commonly-viewable document format, e.g. Word, rich text, markdown.
2. Compose your answers for each question in the document following each question.

##### Questions

1. To filter the states to show only the state of Washington, we set a *Definition Query*; to filter the cities to consist of a subset of all U.S. cities, we performed a selection (*Select By Location*) and exported the result to a new file. What are the differences between a *Definition Query* and a selection export from the perspective of the files saved on the computer?
2. What are the differences between a *Definition Query* and a selection from the perspective of the data displayed on the map?
3. The *Extract Values to Points* tool was run after the original cities dataset had been filtered to include on the cities in Washington. What difference would it have made to perform those actions in the opposite order?
4. Briefly describe the pattern that you see in the distribution of precipitation in Washington (1-2 sentences).
5. Briefly describe the pattern that you see in the distribution of precipitation in the Olympic Peninsula. 
6. Review the *Table of Contents* styles (buttons directly above the layer contents of the TOC panel). List the four styles, and suggest a reason each style would be useful.

##TODO: Other:
Double-check the LC Data Share's data used here (SDCs are old, right?).
