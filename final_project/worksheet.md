# Final Project Worksheet


There will be three sections in the final project: data collection, GIS analysis, and cartography. You will complete all three sections, but will choose one to be your primary focus. This worksheet outlines steps to help plan your final project. A similar document will serve as the final project proposal once it is completeâ€”you may go through several drafts of proposals to work out the details.


Please complete this worksheet and bring it to class with you on Wednesday, may 17th; we will be sharing in groups our ideas as expressed through the worksheet. Each part includes a recommended amount of time to spend on it for this first iteration.
