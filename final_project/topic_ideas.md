# Final Project Topic Ideas

Listed here are ideas for GIScience class project topics, culled from both actual class projects mentioned in other classes, as well as some hypothetical projects. The point here is not to merely pick a topic from the list (though you could), but to see possibilities that may fit your interest & needs with just a few changes. You could:
* Change the topic slightly: find a good place for a new park instead of a coffee shop).
* Change the area of interest: instead of setting it in Eugene, maybe you can set it in Davis, CA.
* Change the time span: do a historic look at the topic, rather than a current(ish) one.

Topics, areas of interest, and time spans are **highly** dependent on what data you can find or create *in the time alotted to you*. Be careful about 

#### Tsunami impacts analysis

Tsunamis pose a serious threat to life and property along the Oregon coastline. In Lab 5, you analyzed the impact of a tsunami in Florence, Oregon. In your lab responses, you considered other ways in which we could quantify or map the impacts of a tsunami wave. Create and answer additional questions related to the impact of a tsunami wave for a new coastal city.

#### Access to services in Eugene

Access to a nearby hospital or police station can mean life or death in an emergency. Likewise, access to important municipal services like parks or schools can improve the quality of life and health of many people. Determine how many and what percentage of Eugene residents do and do not live within a 5 mile and 10 mile radius of a hospital, metropolitan park, police station, and school. Determine which Eugene neighborhood has the lowest access to one of these services.

#### Lane County landslides

Landslide are common in some parts of Oregon. In many cases, it is less safe to live near or on top of a landslide deposit since these areas are prone to further slides. Determine how many people currently live on top of mapped landslide deposits in Lane County. Given a worst-case scenario, how many residents would be affected by widespread landslides? How much infrastructure damage would occur? Are any of Eugene’s roads built on top of landslides deposits?

#### Walkability analysis

When choosing a place to live, the location of the nearest school, shopping area or park is often an important factor in people’s decision-making process. Using data on Eugene or another city you know, determine a set of metrics (that you can get data on!) that make different locations more or less 'walkable', and conduct an analysis that combines these metrics to produce a walkability map of a city or neighborhood.

#### Crime analysis

Crime data can help city managers make safer cities and better allocate their resources. Use spatial crime data to determine which neighborhoods in a city of your choice are the safest and which are the least safe based on at least two different types of crimes. Does less crime occur near police stations; on streets with lighting; in different types of zoning (e.g. residential, or commercial)?

#### Comparison betwee Eugene and another city

Is there a difference between the quality of life in Eugene and another city, such as Springfield? Using the types of analysis described above, determine if the access to services, danger from landslides, walkability, bike-ability, or crime rate is different in Eugene and this other city. Make sure you have access to similar datasets in both cities.
