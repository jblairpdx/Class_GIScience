# GIScience I: Syllabus

##### Description

This class is an introduction to concepts behind organizing, analyzing, and visually presenting geospatial information. This class addresses three major questions:
1. How can one sense and represent the variation in the world around us?
2. How to record, recall, and analyze this information?
3. How to communicate and discuss this information with others?

GIScience I explores these questions though the applied use of software designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, symbolization, and communication of information about the world; that is to turn observations of the real world into information useful for acting in the real world. This is often doen with maps, and much of ther work will involve the creation of maps.

##### Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Plan and execute basic GIS analysis using a software framework.
* Communicate the results of an analysis through language and graphics.
* Identify significant events in the development of GIScience.
* Articulate the characteristics of and differences between data representations.
* Identify and critique choices that made in map design.
* Critically evaluate geospatial arguments in popular media.
* Develop skills in information-seeking.
