# GIScience I: Syllabus

#### Description

This class is an introduction to concepts behind organizing, analyzing, and visually presenting geospatial information. This class addresses three major questions:
1. How can one sense and represent the variation in the world around us?
2. How to record, recall, and analyze this information?
3. How to communicate and discuss this information with others?

GIScience I explores these questions though the applied use of software designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, symbolization, and communication of information about the world; that is to turn observations of the real world into information useful for acting in the real world. This is often doen with maps, and much of ther work will involve the creation of maps.

#### Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Plan and execute basic GIS analysis using a software framework.
* Communicate the results of an analysis through language and graphics.
* Identify significant events in the development of GIScience.
* Articulate the characteristics of and differences between data representations.
* Identify and critique choices that made in map design.
* Critically evaluate geospatial arguments in popular media.
* Develop skills in information-seeking.

## Grading

* 10% - In-class activities. Due at the end of classtime.
* 40% - Lab assignments. Due at the start of the next lab's session.
* 30% - Tests: Three will be conducted, in-class. Due at the end of classtime.
* 20% - Final project. Due on the date/time of our scheduled finals time.

**Late work will be reduced in value by 10% per day late. No late tests or final projects will be accepted.**

#### Lab Sections

There are two lab sections for the course. Lab assignments will be given during the scheduled lab time. During the lab section you have registered for, the SSIL computer lab is reserved for your use and a GTF will be available to present material and answer questions.

If there is space available in the other sections---and the GTF for it gives their permission---you may sit in as a guest. Please understand that the GTF must prioritize the students registered for that section.

Plan ahead, and **save often** while working; computers and software can be unpredictable and crash when one least expects (or wants). Please save your lab files to your student folder on the SSIL server. Feel free to save copies elsewhere.

Most lab assignments will be due at the start of the lab the next week. The exception for this is Lab 7, which will be due in two weeks (this due-week also includes Memorial Day; if your lab is that day, please consider the next school day the due date). You will turn in your lab work digitally via Canvas. Be sure to turn them in before or within the first ten minutes of the lab on their assigned due date.

Assignments may often require extra work outside normal lab hours to complete. Be proactive in ensuring you have access to the tools required to complete it on time, whether that be extra SSIL time or software, VPN, and Canvas access when required.

Lab 7 is twice as much of your grade as the other labs are. Doing the math, Labs 1-6 are 5% each of your class grade; Lab 7 is 10%.

#### Graduate Students

Graduate students will have two additional components to their final project. The first is a description of the analysis you did (5-10 pages). Be sure to provide citations and reasoning for your methodology. The second is to present your project briefly in the last week of class.


## Student Responsibilities

#### Conduct

The University Student Conduct Code (available at conduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or examinations without express permission from the instructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the studentsâ€™ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available at researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism.
