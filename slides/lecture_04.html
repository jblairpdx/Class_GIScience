# Lecture 4: Coordinate systems and projections

## GIS as process

1. Locate entities in the world.
2. **Represent the entities digitally.**
3. Describe the entities.
4. Process, integrate, analyze.
5. Communicate the results.
6. Audience: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

## Coordinate system

A system for georeferencing used to represent locations by their position in *geometric* space.

Coordinate systems are made up of the following components:

1. A measurement framework.
2. Units of measurement.
3. A representative model of the Earth (ellipsoid).
4. A set of control points with known geometric relationship to the reference ellipsoid (datum).

* A 'geographic' coordinate system has a measurement framework with coordinates that measure angles from the Earth's center.
* A 'projected' coordinate system is one where the measurement framework represents a conversion of the spherical location to a 'planimetric' (flat) location.
  * In this case, we should include a fifth component to these coordinate systems: a projection.

But first, let's consider geographic coordinate systems.

---

## Measurement framework: longitude/latitude

* Outer boundary of plane that lies perpendicular to Earth's rotational axis is the *equator*.
  * Outer boundary of a parallel plane a given distance from the equator is called a *parallel*.
  * Points on a parallel share the same latitude.
  * Distance of degrees between parallells is constant: 111.321 km per degree.
* Outer boundary of a plane that includes the rotational axis is a *meridian*.
  * Points on a meridian share the same longitude.
  * Distance of degrees between meridians is **not** constant.

???

* Meridian distance: there are ways, involves trignometry.

---

## Units of measurement: Degrees

* Historically, common to record as `Degrees, Minutes, Seconds` of angle.
  * `123° 42' 20" W, 44° 0' 22" N`
  * Called 'Sexagismal` - 60-based. Used in angles, times.
* More common today to use `Decimal Degrees`.
  * `-123.7056°, 44.00611°`
  * Notice DD often uses negative for W/S, treating 0°, 0° as a graph axis.
* Convert DMS to DD: degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600

## Shape of the Earth

Defining meridians and parallels by the rotational axis allows us to apply them to any rotating object, no matter the shape.

* Convenient, since the Earth is not a perfect sphere.
  * It's actually a bumpy, complex irregular shape called a *geoid*.
    * Bulges around the equator; flattened at the poles.

(heights exaggerated. red = above representative ellipsoid; blue = below)

???

* Bulging & flattening caused by centrigugal forces acting on the planet's mass.
* Earth's mass is not distributed evenly, so bumpy.
* Fun fact: without things like tides, currents, salinity, air pressure, etc. water would cover everything blue on those images.

---

## Representative model: Ellipsoid

Difficult to define coordinates like longitude/latitude on a geoid, though.

To simplify calculations, it's better to use an idealized mathematical representation of the geoid.

* Ellipsoid (spheroid).

---

## Control Points: Datum

From these control points, we can find distance, area, direction between locations on the Earth.

* Amazingly, ellipsoids can vary quite a bit (newer ones are pretty similar).
  * Advances in math & measuring the Earth's mass/shape.
  * Newer ones are pretty similar.
  * Datums do get minor updates (can't stop plate tectonics).
* Datum shift: the slight variation when converting between datums.
  * Important to not forget when using data with different datums.

![http://lp360.com/newsletter/December2014/December2014_2.html](media/TS_Fig3.jpg)

???

* Technically, the datum is the combination of the reference ellipsoid and the control points.
* Big ones around here: WGS84 (all GPS), NAD83 + derivatives (most gov).

---

## Projections

Why flatten the Earth?

* Common mediums of storage are flat: paper, equal grids (field), photos.
* Convenience: easy to conceptualize and **see**; geometry vs. trignometry.
* Historic data collection methods used local flatness for location: surveying, etc.

A projection is the mathematical transformation converting spherical coordinate (longitude/latitude) to a flat *cartesian* coordinate system-

---

## Projections by surface

![http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~dylan/mtpe/geosphere/topics/map/map1.html](media/projections.jpg)

???

* Planar also commonly called *Azimuthal*.
* Not going to get into, but there are hybrids and other funky surface types.

## Projections by preserved property

Most projections minimize distortion of a geometric property.

| Name             | Preserved Property                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Conformal        | angles (general shape)             |
| Equal-area       | area                               |
| Equidistant      | distance from fixed point or line  |
| (less important) |                                    |
| Retroazimuthal   | direction from fixed location      |
| Gnomonic         | none - great circles as lines      |
| 'Compromise'     | none - balance between distortions |
