# Lecture 13: Final project—Introduction & worksheet peer review
.footnote[GIScience I, Spring 2017]

---
class: middle
## Reminder:

* Test 2 is Wednesday, May 25th (covers lectures 7-12).

---
## Lecture outline

1. Approach to project.

2. Project proposal.

3. Project due date/materials.

4. Considerations.

5. Class Activity—Peer feedback.

---
## Approach to project

1. Frame the question(s)/topic/phenomenon of interest.

2. Explore and prepare data.

3. Choose analysis methods and tools.
  * How to restrict or combine data to cover area of extent.
  * How to combine attributes important to answering question together, onto spatial features.
  * How to create better map content.

4. Perform the analysis.

5. Examine and refine results.

6. Present your results.

.footnote[Based on *Esri Training Matters* reading.]

---
## Project proposal

* Complete your proposal by typing into a digital copy of the proposal document. Submit via Canvas.
  * The class materials site has a number of file formats you can download for editing.

* The proposal is due to be submitted by the end of Monday in Week 10 (June 5th).
  * You may submit this earlier if you wish.
  * Though a 'proposal', you probably want to already be working through your project before then.
  * At submission time, this is more of a 'contract' of what you will complete.

* Four sections:
  * Step 1: Problem Identification.
  * Step 2: Data.
  * Step 3: GIS Analysis.
  * Step 4: Cartography.

---
### Proposal Step 1: Problem Identification

* Describe the topic or phenomenon of interest (3-5 complete sentences).
  * Describe in terms of the project's purpose, rather than methods.
  * You may include a conceptual model or high-level flowchart with the description.

* State the location and extent of your study area, using political boundaries, distances, coordinates, etc.
  * Be sure the description is unambiguous.

* Choose one 'primary interest' for your project from the following.
  * Data Collection.
  * GIS Analysis.
  * Cartography.

---
### Proposal Step 2: Data

List all datasets that will be used in the project.
  * List should include at least five data layers.
  * At this point (proposal submission) the data layers should all be known to exist.

If *Data Collection* focus:
* Only three outside data layers required for above.
* Describe dataset you will be creating for project.
  * Data model, feature type, resolution, attributes.
  * Source from which the data will be collected, measured, and/or extracted.
* Evaluation will be based on existence of each of the proposed details, a properly formatted data file, and description of choices that influenced data collection in your report.

---
### Proposal Step 3: GIS Analysis

List all GIS analysis functions and tools that will be used to process the data.
* List should include at least three functions (e.g. selection, definition query, summarize).
* List should include at least one tool (e.g. extract values, clip, slope).
* For each function and tool, indicate which data will be used as input.

If *GIS Analysis* focus:
* Include in the list above one of the following:
  * An analysis that sequences at least three tools.
  * At least one complex tool that was not introduced in a lab.
  * Propose the development and implementation of a GIS processing model (e.g. ModelBuilder).
* Evaluation will be based on correct application of the selected functions and tools, correct interpretation of the results, and explicit justification of the choices of functions and tools in the report.

---
### Proposal Step 4: Cartography

The final map (1-page layout) will include each of the following main elements (in addition to the standard cartographic elements).
* This list should include at least two maps, with one being a context map or detail map.

If "Cartography Focus":
* Inlcude in the list above at least one data graphic:
  * A graph, chart, 3D view, or other visualization.
* Address one of the two cartographic design steps:
  * Generalization of the features.
  * Complex symbology that substantially improves communication of the map's story.
* The proposal should describe the contents of the data graphic and the selected cartographic design step.
* Evaluation will be based on appropriate generalization, the appropriate selection of symbology, cleanliness of the overall layout, and explicit justification for design choices in the report.

---
## Project Due Data/Materials

**The final project will be due before 12:15pm on Tuesday, June 13th.**

To turn in (digitally, via Canvas):
* The map product, as a PDF file.
* A short report describing your project and covering the details requested of your focus (3-6 pages, double spaced).
* If producing a new dataset or model, a zipped-up copy of the produced dataset/model files.

---
### Considerations: Scope

* For most of you, this is your first time directly working on GIS.
  * You're all savvy folks, but you've still only had six weeks behind the wheel.
  * It takes time to figure out how much effort a project will take (I still have problems 15 years in).

.left-column[
* It may be useful to frame the project as a *"Choose Your Own Lab Assignment"*.
  * Labs 1-6 are 5% of your grade each;
  * Lab 7 is 10%;
  * Your project is 20% (5% proposal, 15% turned-in materials).
  * Knowing that, scale accordingly.

---
### Considerations: Time Management

* 27 days between now & the due date (Tue June 13th).
* Be sure that you are progressing through the steps in a timely manner.
* You want to give yourself time for review & refinement.
  * You *will* miss small details (in maps, in text); best to take a second look.
* Grad students: you want to have at least something to discuss & present in week 10 (June 5th & 7th).
* The proposal is due Mon June 5th.
  * It would be best to complete this as early as possible; it will focus your efforts.

---
### Considerations: Data collection
  
* Data collection is time-consuming!
  * See 'Time' above.
  * That's why it's step 2.

* (Lack of) data available/findable may require revising your topic/questions.

---
## Class Activity—Peer feedback

There is great benefit from peer review of your ideas. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of how to communicate ideas to others without actually attempting to do so.
In this activity you will review the project worksheet of a fellow student, and provide feedback on the form that was handed-out.

* Pair up with another student.

* Exchange project worksheets.

* Read through your partner's worksheet.
  * Feel free to ask your partner questions if anything isn't clear.

* Fill out the feedback sheet.
  * Ask more questions as they occur to you.
  * Make suggestions, give (helpful) opinions.

* Hand over the feedback form.
  * Turn the tear-off portion in to the instructor.
  * Give the rest of the form to your partner.
