# Lecture 13: Final project—Introduction & worksheet peer review
.footnote[GIScience I, Spring 2017]

## The ~~Five~~Six-step GIS analysis process

1. Frame the question(s).

2. Explore and prepare data.

3. Choose analysis methods and tools.
  * How to restrict or combine data to cover area of extent.
  * How to combine attributes important to answering question together, onto spatial features.
  * How to create better map content.

4. Perform the analysis.

5. Examine and refine results.

6. Present your results.

### Considerations: Scope

* For most of you, this is your first time directly working on GIS.
  * You're all savvy folks, but you've still only had six weeks behind the wheel.
  * It takes time to figure out how much effort a project will take (I still have problems 15 years in).

.left-column[
* It may be useful to frame the project as a *"Choose Your Own Lab Assignment"*.
  * Labs 1-6 are 5% of your grade each; Lab 7 is 10%. Your project is 20% (5% proposal, 15% turned-in materials).
  * Knowing that, scale accordingly.

### Considerations: Time Management

* There are 27 days until the due date (Tue June 13th).

* Be sure that you are progressing through the six steps in a timely manner.

* You want to give yourself time for review & refinement.
  * You *will* miss small details (in maps, in text); best to take a second look.

* Grad students: you want to have at least something to discuss & present in week 10 (June 5th & 7th).

* The proposal is due Mon June 5th.
  * It would be best to complete this as early as possible; it will focus your efforts.

---
### Considerations: Data collection
  
* Data collection is time-consuming!
  * See 'Time' above.
  * That's why it's step 2.

* (Lack of) data available/findable may require revising your topic/questions.

## Activity—Peer feedback

There is great benefit from peer review of your ideas. Sometimes its easy to lose sight of how to communicate ideas to others without actually attempting to do so.
In this activity you will review the project worksheet of a fellow students, and provide feedback on the form that was handed-out.

* Pair up with another student.

* Exchange project worksheets.

* Read through your partner's worksheet.
  * Feel free to ask your partner questions if anything isn't clear.
* Fill out the feedback sheet.
  * Ask more questions as they occur to you.
  * Make suggestions, give (helpful) opinions.
* Hand over the feedback form.
  * Turn the tear-off portion in to the instructor.
  * Give the rest of the form to your partner.
