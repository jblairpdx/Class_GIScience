## Is spatial special?

* A commonly-heard phrase: "XX% of all information has a spatial component."

* Tobler's First Law of Geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

???

* "XX% of all information has a spatial component."
  - Wild-ass guess, or including a lot of low-value info.
* But there amongst the exaggeration there is truth.
  - Entities and events are likely to occur *somewhere*.
  - Working with spatial information more complex than other types.
    + Adding two numbers vs. adding two areas.

## What is a geographic information system?

> "A geographic information system is a facility for preparing, presenting, and interpreting facts that pertain to the surface of the earth. This is a broad definition..
> a considerably narrower definition, however, is more often employed. In common parlance, a geographic information system or GIS is a configuration of computer hardware and software specifically designed for the acquisition, maintenance, and use of cartographic data."
> (C. Dana Tomlin, 1990).

* GIS is **the process**, not just technology and data.

## GIS as process

(TODO: INSERT TEXTBOOK FIGURE 7.1 SCAN HERE)

(Longley et al 2015)

1. Locate entities in the world.
2. Represent the entities dgitally.
3. Describe the entities.
4. Process, integrate, analyze.
5. Communicate the results.
6. People: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

## 1. Locate entities in the world

.image-50[![Mobile survey data collections in GIS applications in Nepal](media/Survey-App-to-monitor-Nepal-gis.net_.np_-1024x768.jpg)]

*(http://gis.net.np/mobile-survey-data-collection-in-gis-applications/)*

---

## 2. Represent the entities dgitally

![The Real World -> GIS World Model](media/Capture9.png)

*(http://henrico.us/it/gis/)*

---

## 3. Describe the entities

Attributes: individual values describing aspects of the object.

![Parcel atrributes accessed using the parcel ID](media/GUID-39A8F674-382B-49FE-9EFA-97E6B76571C8-web.gif)

*(https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/tables/creating-tables.htm)*

???

* Note 'shape', the geometry, is listed with the attributes.

---

## 4. Process, integrate, analyze

## 5. Communicate the results

## 6. People: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback

## Example of a GIS: Regional Land Information Database of Lane County (RLID)

##TODO: SCREENSHOT OF RLID LANDING PAGE.

##TODO: GIS PROCESS STEPS REPRESENTED IN RLID. SCREENSHOTS. OVERLAY?

##TODO: SLIDE PER A FEW OTHERS (MAKE OTHERS EASY).

## In-class activity: How-to GIS?

* Get in groups of three or four.
* Put your names on a piece of paper.
* Write how you would approach the process steps for one of the following spatial questions:
  - Where should we open a new coffee & donut shop?
  - Which streets and sidewalks should be improved first?
  - Can we predict affected areas from a hazardous spill?
  - Where can we route a high-speed railroad between Portland and Seattle?
  - Where are the facilty coverage gaps in a health provider network?

##TODO: POSSIBLE CLASS ACTIVITY HERE? HAVE STUDENTS PAIR/THREE AND WRITE A SHORT PAIR/THREE GIS EXAMPLES/IDEAS.
