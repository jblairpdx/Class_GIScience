# Lecture 2: What Is GIS?

---

## Geographic Information System

* Term first used in mid-1960s: Canada Geographics Information System (CGIS) - Roger Tomlinson.

* An information system, but for geographic information.
  * What makes geographic information all that special?

---

## "Spatial is special" - Is it?

* A commonly-quoted phrase: "80% of all information has a spatial component."
  * No solid evidence: a guess, or including a lot of low-resolution data and noise.
  * "That geo quote keeps us all in our jobs. Best not go poking around to see if it's true." --John Fagan.

---

## "Spatial Is Special" - It is!

* But there amongst the exaggeration is truth.
  * Entities and events are likely to occur *somewhere*.

* Working with spatial information more complex than other types.
    * Adding two numbers vs. adding two areas.

* Tobler's First Law of Geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
  * Think about: weather, topography, dialect, demographics...

---

## What is a geographic information system?

GIS is technology.

> "A geographic information system is a facility for preparing, presenting, and interpreting facts that pertain to the surface of the earth. This is a broad definition...
>
> A considerably narrower definition, however, is more often employed. In common parlance, a geographic information system or GIS is a configuration of computer hardware and software specifically designed for the acquisition, maintenance, and use of cartographic data."
>
> (C. Dana Tomlin, 1990).
<!-- https://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/intro/intro.html-->

* Kind of tautological: "GIS is the things we need to do GIS."

???

* A bit like saying "Cooking is the things we need to eat."

---

## What is a geographic information system? (cont.)

GIS is technology + data + people.

> "[A GIS is] an organized collection of computer hardware, software, geographic data, and personnel designed to efficiently capture, store, update, manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced information."
>
> (Esri, 1990)

---

## What is a geographic information system? (cont.)

GIS *integrates* technology.

* GIS links a number of discrete technologies to create a whole greater than the parts.
  * Cartography and mapping;
  * CAD;
  * Databases;
  * Statistics;
  * Math (geometry/trignometry/topology);
  * Image processing;
  * Remote sensing;
  * Computer graphics;

* Over its history, GIS picked up extra technologies to extend the ones already present.

* Anyone familiar with any of these technologies will see the influences in modern GIS software.

---

## What is a geographic information system? (cont.)

GIS is the **process** of using integrated technologies + data.

.left-column[
1. Locate entities in the world.

2. Represent the entities digitally.

3. Describe the entities.

4. Process, integrate, analyze.

5. Communicate the results.

6. Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

* This is the structure this class is organized by.

## Step 1: Locate entities in the world

.left-column[
.image-100[![Mobile survey data collections in GIS applications in Nepal (http://gis.net.np/mobile-survey-data-collection-in-gis-applications/)](media/Survey-App-to-monitor-Nepal-gis.net_.np_-1024x768.jpg)]
  ]
.right-column[
* Collecting where they happen.
  * GPS, surveying, fieldwork.
  * Remote capture: images (satellite, airplane, car, etc.); sensors.
* Coding a spatial location onto collected information.
  ]
---

## Step 2: Represent the entities digitally

.image-90[![The Real World -> GIS World Model (http://henrico.us/it/gis/)](media/Capture9.png)]

* How should your data appear in digital form?
* What generalizations & distortions can we accept for our purposes?

---

## Step 3: Describe the entities

Attributes: individual values describing aspects of the object.

.left-column[
.image-100[![Parcel atrributes accessed using the parcel ID (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/tables/creating-tables.htm)](media/GUID-39A8F674-382B-49FE-9EFA-97E6B76571C8-web.gif)]
  ]
.right-column[
* Data values used to describe an entity, beyond coding the location.
* Data-wise, at the core of the integrative definition. Connects location to:
  * Databases;
  * Map symbolization;
  * Statistical analysis;
* Geometry/shape is first-order description attribute.
  * Properties: area, perimeter, etc.;
  * Statistics: centrality, dispersion, etc.;
  * Literal: describes the entity;
  ]

---

## Step 4. Process, integrate, analyze

.image-110[![The layout of a suitability model (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/analyze/main/what-is-geoprocessing.htm)](media/GUID-A4A78FE3-3B8F-48DD-BD7F-9BD7DE04D886-web.png)]

* What methods need done to make data able to answer our questions/find patterns/inform decisions?
* Combining, excluding, or altering data that share location or description (attributes), e.g.
  * Integrating multiple sources of data.
  * Adding attributes (e.g. districts) from data that spatially overlaps your data.
  * Limiting your study area to a specific region.
  * Creating new spatial entities from your data to represent a new, related entity (e.g. buffer zones).

---

## Step 5: Communicate the results

Maps; reports; "the answer".

## Step 6: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback

.image-100[![https://www.climate-eval.org/blog/answer-42-data-information-and-knowledge](media/Data-information-knowledge-wisdom.png)]

---

## Example of a GIS: Regional Land Information Database of Lane County (RLID)

.image-90[![https://rlid.org/](media/RLID_Stages.png)]

* Website & database with highly-integrated information organized for easy use.
* Primary point of reference for data is land/property, embodied by taxlots & site addresses.
* 100+ integrations via spatial methods (overlays, distance/proximity).
* Even more via shared identifiers.

---

## In-class activity: GIS process components

* Get in groups of three or four.
* Put your names on a piece of paper.
* Answer for one of the following questions (left) how you could approach the steps in the GIS process (right). Answer in general terms, but try to be thoughtful/creative about it.

.left-column[
* Where should we open a new coffee/donut shop?
* Can we predict affected areas from a hazardous spill?
* Which parts of the city should public works staff go to for cleanup/graffiti/landscaping?
]
.right-column[
1. Locate entities in the world.
2. Represent the entities digitally.
3. Describe the entities.
4. Process, integrate, analyze.
5. Communicate the results.
6. Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.
  ]

???

* Coffee/donut.
  1. Existing shops/competitors? Available properties? Water features?
  2. Points? Property lots?
  3. Attributes: property cost, sales information?
  4. Combine with neighborhood demographics/economics; distance to positive factors (quality customers, venues); distance buffer around existing shops?
  5. Map of collected entities; buffers.
* Hazardous spill.
  1. Spill location? Vulnerable property types (homes, utilities)?
  2. Point, maybe expand to area as more information collected?
  3. Spill type; quantity?
  4. Use slope representation to estimate direction of flow? Simpler: buffers of incrementing distance?
  5. Map of potential areas to evacuate/verify?
* City staff.
  1. Complaint locations? Neighborhood/zone areas?
  2. Complaints as points? Maybe buffered to areas (uncertainty)?
  3. Complaint types (graffiti, landscaping, trash, disrepair)?
  4. Overlay complaints on neighborhood areas (counts)? Overlay ownership types (public or private)? Group by nearest road right-of-way?
  5. Map (of course)? Maybe a list?
