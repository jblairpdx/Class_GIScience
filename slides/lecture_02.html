# Lecture 2: What Is GIS?

---

## Is spatial special?

* A commonly-quoted phrase: "80% of all information has a spatial component."
  * No solid evidence: a guess, or including a lot of low-resolution data and noise.
  * "That geo quote keeps us all in our jobs. Best not go poking around to see if it's true." --John Fagan.

* Tobler's First Law of Geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

???

* But there amongst the exaggeration is truth.
  * Entities and events are likely to occur *somewhere*.
  * Working with spatial information more complex than other types.
    * Adding two numbers vs. adding two areas.

## What is a geographic information system?

GIS is technology.

> "A geographic information system is a facility for preparing, presenting, and interpreting facts that pertain to the surface of the earth. This is a broad definition...
>
> A considerably narrower definition, however, is more often employed. In common parlance, a geographic information system or GIS is a configuration of computer hardware and software specifically designed for the acquisition, maintenance, and use of cartographic data."
>
> (C. Dana Tomlin, 1990).

## What is a geographic information system? (cont.)

GIS is technology + data + people.

> "[A GIS is] an organized collection of computer hardware, software, geographic data, and personnel designed to efficiently capture, store, update, manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced information."
>
> (Esri, 1990)

## What is a geographic information system? (cont.)

GIS integrates technology.

* GIS links a number of discrete technologies to create a whole greater than the parts.
  * Cartography and mapping;
  * CAD;
  * Databases;
  * Statistics;
  * Math (geometry/trignometry/topology).
  * Image processing;
  * Remote sensing;
  * Computer graphics.

## GIS as process

GIS is f**the process**, not just technology and data.

.left-column[
1. Locate entities in the world.

2. Represent the entities digitally.

3. Describe the entities.

4. Process, integrate, analyze.

5. Communicate the results.

6. Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

## 1. Locate entities in the world

---

## 2. Represent the entities digitally

.image-90[![The Real World -> GIS World Model (http://henrico.us/it/gis/)](media/Capture9.png)]

---

## 3. Describe the entities

Attributes: individual values describing aspects of the object.

![Parcel atrributes accessed using the parcel ID (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/tables/creating-tables.htm)](media/GUID-39A8F674-382B-49FE-9EFA-97E6B76571C8-web.gif)

???

* Note 'shape', the geometry, is listed with the attributes.

## 4. Process, integrate, analyze

## 5. Communicate the results

## 6. Interpret, make decisions, give feedback

## Example of a GIS: Regional Land Information Database of Lane County (RLID)

.image-90[![https://rlid.org/](media/RLID_Stages.png)]

* Website & database with highly-integrated information organized for easy use.
* Primary point of reference for data is land/property, embodied by taxlots & site addresses.
* 100+ integrations via spatial methods (overlays, distance/proximity).
* Even more via shared identifiers.

## In-class activity: GIS process components

* Get in groups of three or four.
* Put your names on a piece of paper.
* Answer for one of the following questions (left) how you could approach the steps in the GIS process (right). Answer in general terms, but try to be thoughtful about it.

.left-column[
* Where should we open a new coffee & donut shop?
* Which streets and sidewalks should be improved first?
* Can we predict affected areas from a hazardous spill?
* Where can we route a high-speed railroad between Portland and Seattle?
* Where are the facilty coverage gaps in a health provider network?
