# Lecture 7: Spatial analysis—location, distance, area

---

## GIS as process

1. Locate entities in the world.

2. Represent the entities digitally.

3. Describe the entities.

4. **Process, integrate, analyze.**

5. Communicate the results.

6. Audience: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

---

## Spatial analysis

* Can be thought of as similar to statistical analysis, but including a 2-D coordinate plain.

* However assumptions of statistical analysis are not valid here.

* Spatial analysis are the steps we undertake to convert raw spatial data into the useful information we've set out to get.
  * Add value in transformations, which bring out patterns & anomalies.

???

* Statistical assumptions:
  * Normaility: Somewhat normal distribution.
  * Homogeneity of variances: Data from multiple groups have the same variance.
  * Linearity: Data have a linear relationship.
  * Independence: Data are independent.

---

## Types of Spatial Analysis

Three main types:

1. Analysis based on location (one dimension).

2. Analysis based on distance (two dimensions).

3. Analysis based on area (three dimensions).

## Analysis based on location

* Identifying **where** something exists or happens.

* The ability to compare different properties of the same place.
  * Discover relationships, correlations, 'hotspots'.

* Would be convenient if we had data model where every location was represented, with every property attributed directly on it.

* However spatial data models and their implementations tend to emphasize carrying a few properties for all places over a lot of properties for one place.
  * Raster data model limits to one.
  * Maintenance simplicity and "normalization" tends to limit how much one can 'hang' on a single dataset.
  * Horizontal vs. vertical integration of data.

* For that reason, we need ways to be able to collect the properties at a location: to bring all the attributes into a single feature.

???

* Normalization is the concept that a system shouldn't have more than one copy of data.
  * Using Duckweb as an example: your name should only be written in one place.
  * If another part of the system needs your name, it would just store an ID attribute (95 number) to connect one to the other.
  * That way if you ever changed your name, the change would automatically be available to all references, wih only a single update.

---

## Point-in-polygon operation

* Determining whether a point lies inside or outside a polygon.
  * Which one, if in?

* It's quite useful to apply areal properties to point locations.
