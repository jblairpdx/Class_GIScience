## GIS as process

1. Locate entities in the world.
2. **Represent the entities digitally.**
3. Describe the entities.
4. Process, integrate, analyze.
5. Communicate the results.
6. Audience: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

---

## What is representation?

* A real-world entity converted into data defined and stored in the system.
* Atomic element of representation: A location, (a time), and an attribute.
* **The Fundamental Problem**: The world is infinitely complex, but computer systems are finite.
* Key is to understand what to record and what to discard for your purposes.

???

* Really, all man-made systems are finite.

Consider your contacts in your phone/email/rolodex.

![Contact](media/contact.png)

???

* Information stored about a contact isn't a complete description of the person.
* An approximation, primarily focused on the needs for contacting them.

---

## Discrete objects vs. continuous fields

* Discrete object view: the world is empty, except where it is occupied by objects the defined boundaris that are instances of recognized categories.
  - Objects can be counted.
  - Objects have dimensionality.
  - Objects can be associated with multiple attributes.

???

* Counting, attributes: these tend to lend themselves well to inventories; to censuses; to esy-to-determine dimensions.

---

## Discrete objects vs. continuous fields

* continuous field view: the world is a finite number of variables, each one defined at every possible position.
  - Fields show variance.
  - Fields show smoot patterns (and disruptive ones).

???

* In many ways an inversion of discrete objects.
* But there are many phenomena that do have object distinction (or an easy way to fake it).
* Tough question: how to represent a 'soil inventory'?
* Also: emergence of patterns can tie field + discrete together: could you create a discrete object representation from a pattern in a field representation?

---

## Types of spatial objects

* Point (0 dimensions).
* Line (1 dimension).
* Area (2 dimensions).
* Volume (3 dimensions).

* Real-world entities can have a representation that approximates their real-world geometry, or an artificial reclassification.
* How one chooses to represent the entities is dependent on scale.

???

* Reclassification:
  - Lower-dimension: City area --> city point.
  - Higher-dimension: Person --> aggregate population; weather station --> continuous temperature map.

---

## Sidebar: Scale

Scale has a number of meanings.

* Scale of *detail*.
  - Alt: 'spatial resoultion' or 'level of spatial detail'.
  - Fine-scaled vs. coarse-scaled data.
* Scale of *extent*.
  - 'Large-scale' covers a large area, 'small-scale' covers a small area.
* Scale of the *map*.
  - Alt: 'representative fraction'.
  - Ratio of distance on the map to distance in the real world.
  - 'Large-scale' has a bigger fraction, but covers a small area (!!!).

???

* Don't let large/small scale trip you up. Just make sense.
* You can be more specific.

---

## Generalization

* Details of a spatial represenation must be carefully selected to fit the GIS system (and the ability to collect the data).
* To be sure, all digital representations are generalized to a degree.
* In context of spatial representations, we can consider ten types of generalizations:
