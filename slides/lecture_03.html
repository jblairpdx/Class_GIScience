# Lecture 3: Spatial representation; georeferencing

## GIS as process

1. Locate entities in the world.

2. **Represent the entities digitally.**

3. Describe the entities.

4. Process, integrate, analyze.

5. Communicate the results.

6. Audience: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

---
## What is spatial representation?

A real-world entity converted into data defined and stored in the system.

Atomic element of representation: A location, (a time), and an attribute.

**The Fundamental Problem**: The world is infinitely complex, but computer systems are finite.

* Key is to understand what to record and what to discard for your purposes.

???

* Sometimes you'll hear 'modeling' the Earth instead of representing.
  * I chose representing, matches up with our process concept better.
  * There's also other terms we'll use with 'model' or 'modeling' in them (which we'll talk about later).

* Really, all man-made systems are finite.

---
Consider contacts in your phone/email/rolodex.

![Contact](media/contact.png)

???

* Information stored about a contact isn't a complete description of the person.

* An approximation, primarily focused on the needs for contacting them.

---
## Representation types

Spatial representations are recorded in a GIS as one of two types: 'discrete objects' or 'continuous fields'.

---
## Discrete object view

* "The world is empty, except where it is occupied by objects whose defined boundaries are instances of recognized categories."
* Objects can be counted.
* Objects have dimensionality.
* Objects can be associated with multiple attributes.
* Spatial representation of objects often called features - to distinguish from non-spatial objects.

.image-70[![https://archive.epa.gov/region5/superfund/fields/web/html/gis.html](media/gis_illustration.jpg)]

???

* Counting, attributes - these tend to lend themselves well to:
  * Inventories;
  * Censuses
  * Easy-to-determine dimensions.

---
## Types of discrete spatial objects

* Point (0 dimensions).
* Line (1 dimension).
* Area (2 dimensions).
* Volume (3 dimensions).

![https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/geodatabases/feature-class-basics.htm](media/GUID-49497935-EDB0-4BCA-8861-8BE08F89AAA9-web.gif)

* Real-world entities can have a representation that approximates their real-world geometry, or an artificial reclassification.
* How one chooses to represent the entities is dependent on scale.

???

* Reclassification:
  - Lower-dimension: City area --> city point.
  - Higher-dimension: Person --> aggregate population.

---
## Representation types (cont.)

#### Continuous field view: the world is a finite number of variables, each one defined at every possible position.

* Field shows variance.

* Field shows smooth patterns (and disruptive ones).

???

* In many ways an inversion of discrete objects.

* But there are many phenomena that do have object distinction (or an easy way to fake it).

* Tough question: how to represent a 'soil inventory'?

* Also: emergence of patterns can tie field + discrete together: could you create a discrete object representation from a pattern in a field representation?

---
## Sidebar: Scale

Scale has a number of meanings.

* Scale of *detail*.
  - Alt: 'spatial resoultion' or 'level of spatial detail'.
  - Fine-scaled vs. coarse-scaled data.
* Scale of *extent*.
  - 'Large-scale' covers a large area, 'small-scale' covers a small area.
* Scale of the *map*.
  - Alt: 'representative fraction'.
  - Ratio of distance on the map to distance in the real world.
  - 'Large-scale' has a bigger fraction, but covers a small area (!!!).

???

* Don't let large/small scale trip you up. Just make sense.
* You can be more specific.

## Generalization

> "... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography."

Borges, J. L. 1998. On exactitude in science. P. 325, In, Jorge Luis Borges, Collected Fictions (Trans. Hurley, H.) Penguin Books.

???

* Illustrative of the problems.

---
## Generalization (cont.)

* Details of a spatial represenation must be carefully selected to fit the GIS system (and the ability to collect the data).
* To be sure, all digital representations are generalized to a degree.
* In context of spatial representations, we can consider ten types of generalizations:

???

* When doing mapping or analysis at a certain scale, detail can be distracting, problematic.
  * Visually, but also when analyzing with multiple sets of data of different detail.

* Consider even scale of collection.
  * Digitizing less-detailed maps.
  * Accuracy of collection technology.

## Generalization (cont.)

.image-50[![Longley, et al 2015](media/Longley_et_al_Figure_3.15.png)]

???

* Many of these rarely apply to anything but mapping, rather than analysis.

* There can be analysis requirements for generalization, though:
  * Systems that have an upper limit on the amount of detail they can handle.
    * Example: road-modeling systems can combine roads (divided highways, whole neighborhoods, external connections).
  * Where you can only have one object per unique identification.
    * Example: Living Learning Center - 2 buildings, but one name.

---
## In-class activity: Representation

* Get in groups of two or three.
* Put your names on a piece of paper.
* Discuss how you would represent the following phenomena in a GIS (consider object v. field, scale, generalization):
  * Restaurants in a city.
  * Local parks and playgrounds.
  * World cities.
  * Vegetation classes.

---
## Georeferencing (geolocating) (geocoding)

Tagging a data object with a spatial location.

* Must be unique.
* Should be persistent.
* Understandable by the system that will interpret it.

???

* Unique: 'Green Mountain' occurs 153 times in USGS Geographic Names Information System; 21 in Oregon; 2 in Linn County!
* Persistent: names change (Centennial Blvd -> Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd, Saigon -> Ho Chi Minh City).
* Understandable: 'system' can be a computer or a person. Most western addresses are consistently understandable by folks in the area.
