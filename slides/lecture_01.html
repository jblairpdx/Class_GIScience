# Lecture 1: Class introduction

**GEOG 4/581**

???
  
* Class is GIScience I, GEOG 4/595.

## Instructors

* *Course/lecture:* Jacob Blair
  - Email: jblair3@uoregon.edu
  - Office hours: Fridays 8:00-10:00, 109 Condon [(map)](https://map.uoregon.edu/99b67d6a9)
  - Work as a GIS Analyst/Developer for Lane Council of Governments (LCOG).

???

* Not a professor, doctor, etc.
* Just a master's degree and a decade+ working GIS industry.
* Never even taught a class beyond being a GE for a class like this.
* Worked for LCOG since 2007, with brief sojourn on the East Coast.
* Currently the "data plumber" and admin for in-house GIS team and a multi-government data-sharing partnership.

* You'll get to know GEs better via your labs.
* Don't hesitate to use them.

## Description

This class is an introduction to concepts behind organizing, analyzing, and visually presenting geospatial information. This class addresses three major questions:
1. How can one sense and represent the variation in the world around us?
2. How to record, recall, and analyze this information?
3. How to communicate and discuss this information with others?

GIScience I explores these questions though the applied use of software designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, symbolization, and communication of information about the world; that is to turn observations of the real world into information useful for acting in the real world. This is often doen with maps, and much of ther work will involve the creation of maps.

???

* Note the 'applied' part.
* I'll be talking about these things in class conceptually, then you'll apply them in the lab.
* Key to taking something from this class is to connect the two.
* May seem like learning button-pushing, but those buttons are pushed in service of something.

## Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Plan and execute basic GIS analysis using a software framework.
* Communicate the results of an analysis through language and graphics.
* Articulate the characteristics of and differences between data representations.
* Identify and critique choices that made in map design.
* Critically evaluate geospatial arguments in popular media.
* Develop skills in information-seeking.

???

* Software: we'll be using ArcGIS Desktop (primarily ArcMap).
* There are many others. Some similar, some very different. Concepts cut across them all.
* There is lots of jargon: take a breath. Even pros use all kinds of names, forget what means what.
  - Ex. geocode vs. overlay; what the heck does scale mean?

---

## Texts

* *Geographic Information Science and Systems*, Fourth Edition (2015), by Longley, et al.
* *Supplemental reading will be available via links in schedule or the Canvas class site.*

???

* I'm not particularly a big fan of this textbook.
  - Used by other instructors.
  - I hear it is used for the follow-up class.
* Is useful to prepare you for the week's lectures.
* Will try to fill-in with supplemental readings **where useful**.
  - Not trying to pile on for make-work.
