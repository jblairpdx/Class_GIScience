# Lecture 9: Spatial modeling

---
## GIS as process

1. Locate entities in the world.

2. Represent the entities digitally.

3. Describe the entities.

4. **Process, integrate, analyze.**

5. Communicate the results.

6. Audience: Interpret, make decisions, give feedback.

## Spatial modeling â€” oh great, another use of the word 'model'?

---
## Yes, another one

Spatial modeling is a sequence of operations on spatial data combined into a single whole, for a single purpose.

* All steps in the sequence are means to the desired output or endpoint of the model.

* The sequence should be considered a 'model' representation of a thematically singular geospatial process or property.
  * A collection of unrelated tasks isn't a model: that's just a to-do list.

* The 'spatial data model' represents collected information; a GIS/spatial model here is is an expression of a process in the world.
  * Simulations of natural or social proceses.
  * Human-designed processes for decision-making or solving a problem.
  * Calculations of indicators or predictors.
  * Automation of standard workflows.

---
## Common traits of GIS/spatial models

* Multiple stages of transformation & analysis - sequential or looping.

* Allow for experimenting/alteration of options & scenarios.
  * Change inputs.
  * Change operational details.
  * Replace/rewrite individual part(s).

* Can have their individual stages run separately/manually (with proper inputs).

* Can be expressed by a flowchart or a list/script of ordered operations/stages.

* Can be developed in a system that properly represents its flow or sequencing and has access to the necessary operations/tools.

## Static vs. dynamic

* Static model
  * Represents a single point in time, or unchanging system.
  * Typically designed as multiple inputs -> single output.
  * Example: Location analysis - where to open our next coffee shop.
* Dynamic model
  * Model loops through certain stages in multiple *iterations*.
  * System parameters change over iterations of the model.
  * Example: Disease outbreak analysis.

## Individual vs. aggregate

* Individual, or agent-based models calculate process results for every discrete actor in the system.
  * Requires lots of computing power.
  * Also requires lots of knowledge about actors.
  * Common use for modeling human/animal behavior.

* Aggregate models simulate process results for collective units.
  * Useful when individual parts too numerous to track, or observation/theory applies at a higher level.
  * Common use for modeling physical processes.

## Cellular models

* Raster representation.
* Each cell has a number of possible states.
* States change through time from applying transition rules in stages.
* A rule's effect on cell often take into account:
  * Current state.
  * States of neighboring cells.
  * Associated attribute values of cell (via an attribute table, overlaid companion rasters).
* Common to use for dynamic models where the state of the neighboring locations has high impact on outcomes.

## How does one build a model?

A common approach to developing a model:

1. Sketch likely steps needed to get desired results (maybe draw flowchart, or script in pseudocode).
2. Run steps manually to verify correct steps.
3. Refine documentation/flowchart/pseudocode.
4. Use model-building application to create an executable single version of your model.
5. (Optional) Program scripting code to refine model and manage quirks/edge cases.
6. (Optional) Program lower-level code to create model as own application or tool, maximize speed/power/stability.

## Flowcharts

* Lots of flowchart applications out there:
  * IMHO few feel simple or easy-to-use.
  * Quality of tools and output generally varies with cost.
  * Microsoft Visio ($$), Wizflow Flowcharter ($), www.draw.io (ðŸ˜„), Google Drawings (ðŸ˜„), etc.
* Honestly, drawing flowcharts by hand isn't that painful, gets easier every time you do it.

---
## Flowcharts (cont.)

* Don't need to be fancy with chart graphics. Just need a couple distinct types.
  * Datasets - commonly represented as ellipses.
  * Operations - commonly represented as rectangles.
* Can add some extra frills if you'd like:
  * Color variations on each type (e.g. input/intermediate/ouput dataset; tentative vs. verified operation).

## Model-building app â€” ModelBuilder for ArcGIS Desktop

* A flowchart program that creates the model as you connect the flowchart.
* Create a new *Toolbox* (.tbx file), then create model(s) within.
* When run inside ArcMap, enables access to your active data frame's contents, places output there.

## Advantages of Creating/Using Models

* Repeatableâ€”with or without variations.

* Self-documenting.

* Shareable.
  * Usable by anyone else with access to model & supporting apps.
  * Embeds expertise.

* Organizes workflow/process into distinct parts.
  * Can plan & develop analysis through modeling a skeleton, and adding complexity as you go.
  * 'Minimum viable product.'
