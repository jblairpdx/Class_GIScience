## Definitions

#### Cartography

> "Cartography is concerned with the art, science, and techniques of making maps and charts."

*Longley, et al. (2015)*

> "Cartography is the discipline dealing with conception, production, dissemination and study of maps."

*International Cartographic Association (1997)*

#### "Map"

> "A map is a symbolized image of geographical reality, representing selected features or characteristics, resulting from the creative effort of its author's execution of choices, and is designed for use when spatial relationships are of primary relevance."

*International Cartographic Association (1997)*

---
## Function of maps

Maps are the most prominent type of GIS output.

* Storage and communication	mechanisms of geographic information.
  * Historically, maps **were** the GIS system.

* Communicate results of analyses.

* Communicate	spatial-temporal relationships among phenomena within a map/among maps.

* Provide decision support through clear communication.

* Create or reinforce a particular message ("tell a story").
  * Even incorrect or improper messages.

---
## Types of maps.

* Reference map.
  * Emphasis on location.
  * All data at same level of importance.
  * Subtype—special-purpose map: a reference map, but made for specific types of users/uses.
* Thematic map.
  * Emphasis on specific geographic theme.
  * Thematic data given emphasis in the visualization.
  * Theme serves to promote analysis results, relationships, messages to user's attention.

### Choropleth map

* Predefined areas (enumeration units) are shaded to differentiate data values.
* All kinds of things can be used for the areas
  * Political boundaries (states, counties).
  * Convenient areas for collection and scale (census tracts).
  * Any definable division of area on the Earth (equal-area grids, hexbins).

## Map series.

A collection of reference or thematic maps created in the same way, but varying in the extent covered.
* Same data, symbolization, map elements, (usually) same scale.
* Examples:
  * University of Oregon Atlas of Trees (InfoGraphics Lab).
  * Oregon Scenic Bikeways (Oregon State Parks).

# Part 2: Map design

---
## Controlling factors

* Purpose.
  * Determines what to map and how to portray that information.
* Reality.
  * The phenomena being mapped will affect design choices (e.g. orientation of landforms).
* Available data.
  * The representation and data model affects how one can symbolize.
  * Where data was collected & how good/detailed it is can limit map etxtent or expression of pattern.
* Map scale.
  * Affects the amount of detail visible/viewable.
  * Could limit method & type of symbolization.

---
## Controlling factors (cont.)

* Audience.
  * Expert vs. general audience.
  * Also: disability can affect audience needs (visual impairment; color blindness).
* Conditions of use.
  * Indoor vs. outdoor (lighting).
  * FUll concentration vs. distracted.
* Technical limits.
  * The display medium.
    - Print vs. digital; print/display quality.
    - Media size: phone vs. laptop vs. projection screen.
    - Data storage: website loading, local disk, in the graphic.
  * The available technology for composing the map.

---
## Who is the map for? (audience)

1. Experts.
  * Less peripheral information explaining the map content and symbols.
  * More information, more variables, more detail.
  * Follow conventions of field.

2. Novices (general public?)
  * More peripheral information on map explaining details and symbols.
  * Less information, fewer variables, less detail.
  * Follow map design conventions, enhance comprehension for novice map readers.
  * Not about 'dumbing-down' the map; it's about keeping your audience engaged.

---
## Composition—key elements

.image-100[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Map body.
  * Principal focus of the map. Give space and symbolization appropriate to its significance.
  * Can be more than one, if needing to compare between areas, themes, times.

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Inset or overview map(s).
  * Optional, but useful to highlight part of map in greater detail, or provide the larger context for the map area.

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Title.
  * Concisely identify map's subject. Usually describes the area the map covers and the data theme.
  * Main map body can share a title with the entire map document.

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Legend.
  * List of items represented on the map and how they're symbolized.
  * Should be complete. Can omit some symbolization when the context is obvious (e.g. water features when not theme focus).

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Scale.
  * Indicate relative size and distance between the map and the real-world.
  * Display as scale bar or representative fraction/text.

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Direction indicator.
  * Directional symbol (north arrow, compass, etc.) good when direction is consistent in map.
  * Graticule good when direction distorts on map.

---
.image-80[![Longley et al, 2015 Figure 11.9](media/longley_4e_fig_11_09.jpg)]

* Map metadata.
  * Map projection.
  * Date of creation/last update.
  * Author.
  * Data sources.
    - These are important to know: trustworthiness; credit where is due; currency check.
    - Omission is a judgment call: relevance; terms of use; media constraints.

---
## Symbolization—visual variables

* Visual variables are categories of visual "clues" to indicate on the map value differentiation, and relationship between each other.

* These are the drivers of the thematic symbolization methods mentioned in Part 1.

* Key is to choose visual variables that highlight the variation in the data.

.image-100[![Bertin, Meacham](media/Meacham_Visual_Variables.png)]

---
## Multivariate map

More than one visual variable is chosen to symbolize a single collection of features, each variable representing

.right-column[.image-110[![https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1871](media/hue_value_choropleth.png)]]

---
## Data classification

.left-column[
* Keep the number of distinct variable classes low.
* People can usually only manage 5-7 distinct objects at once.
* Considerations:
  * Classification method.
  * Number of classes.
  * Decimal places.
]
.right-column[.image-100[![Longley, etl al 2015](media/longley_4e_fig_11_14.jpg)]]

---
## Visual hierarchy

* Definition: The arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance.

* Considerations:
  * Size and placement of map elements.
  * Map symbolization.
    * ColorBrewer — Color advice for cartography [http://colorbrewer2.org/](http://colorbrewer2.org/).

* Use available space without adding clutter.
  * Space in margins.
  * Available/unimportant space in map.
* Emphasizing similarity and difference in visual hierarchy:
  * **C**ontrast — **R**epetition — **A**lignment — **P**roximity

## Better mapping

Credit to The British Cartographic Society for the following slides...

* Even if you have checked and checked again it is always worth one final check before the map is signed off as complete

* The more you work on a map the less you will see the errors — it is the obvious ones which will get through, such as the misspelling of familiar words.

* There's no magic program for making the perfect map.
  * If there were, we'd just program computers to make them.
  * This is where the "art & craft" part of the cartography definition come in.
  * You get better by understanding the conventions, paying attention to detail, and **doing**.

---
## Better mapping in 5 minutes

Check...

* your map title — is it brief and directly related to the map?

* the scale of the map — is it correct?

* the units of your scale bar — are they rounded?(e.g. 5km, not 4.85km) and easy to understand?

* the legend — do all the symbols in your legend match the map?

* the insets — Does each have a title and scale bar?

---
## Better mapping in 15 minutes

As well as the above, check...

* does the map fit the page or the screen?

* does your legend state the right units (e.g. density per km²)?

* your spelling.

* the visual balance — do the important parts naturally stand out?

* the alignment of objects — do lines created by edges (of elements, neatlines, and whitespace) flow between elements, or do they shift or break up?

---
## Better mapping in 50 minutes

As well as the above, check...

* get a second opinion on your map design.

* if it's a web map, try it on different platforms.

* if it's a printed map, try printing it on different printers/paper.

* print it and proof it off screen (even if digital).
